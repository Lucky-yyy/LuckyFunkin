# LuckyFunkin
Another Friday Night Funkin' engine that made in Godot Engine

# The reason why I'm developing this engine.

I've lost the motivation to make my own fnf mod, so my goal will be to make an engine that is completely clean and optimized.

# Features

 - **Uses less memory than the OG Engine**
	 - yes
 - **Planning to make multiplayer system**
	 - FNF Vs. Online sucks cuz its made in ctf 2.5.
	 - ShadowMario FNF Multiplayer is outdated af.
